In reading the instructions for part 3, there seemed to be some ambiguities in the cube mirroring functionality.
We assumed that the intent is to mirror the cube across a vertical plane, and that the rotation of the cube should mirror the movement of the player's view across this plane.

We have all contributed to this code in an equitable manner and agree that, to the best of our knowledge, it accurately represents our understanding for the assignment.
