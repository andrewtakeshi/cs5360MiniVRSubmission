# Mini VR Project Submission
## Notes
### General
This repository was created specifically for submission of the assignment. We worked on the project in another repository, available [here](https://github.com/u0398022/CS5963_Assignment1_1/)(permission may need to be requested to view the repo). 
### Part 1:
There are no particulars for this portion of the assignment. 
### Part 2:
For part 2, we chose to do the extra credit. We used Google Sketchup to create our custom room.
### Part 3: 
For part 3, we found some ambiguity in the instructions for mirroring. We assumed that the intent was to mirror the cube across a vertical plane, and that the rotation of the cube should mirror the movement of the player's view across the play. However, much like an actual mirror, we assumed that the cube should match the player's movement (rather than mirror it) across the plane. We have also added a 'face' to the cube to make it much more clear as to what the front and back of the cube are. 
## Required Statement
We have all contributed to this code in an equitable manner and agree that, to the best of our knowledge, it accurately represents our understanding for the assignment.
